Laplacians is a package containing graph algorithms, with an emphasis on tasks
related to spectral and algebraic graph theory. It contains (and will contain
more) code for solving systems of linear equations in graph Laplacians, low
stretch spanning trees, sparsifiation, clustering, local clustering, and
optimization on graphs.

All graphs are represented by sparse adjacency matrices. This is both for speed,
and because our main concerns are algebraic tasks. It does not handle dynamic
graphs. It would be very slow to implement dynamic graphs this way.
