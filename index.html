<p><strong>PANDA | METRIC</strong> is a framework for machine learning based on the concept of metric spaces, which makes it possible to
use and combine arbitrary data to build models. METRIC is written in modern C++ to provide the best performance.
However, due to Python bindings, you can use it directly in Python.</p>

<h1 id="short-introduction">Short introduction</h1>
<h2 id="general-concept">General Concept</h2>
<p>A metric space is defined by a set of records (aka elements, observations, points etc.) and a corresponding metric,
which is a distance function with special requirements that can compares records pair-wise about similarity.</p>
<p>Almost all algorithms of this framework operate on metric spaces. However, in most situations, it is not necessary to
build such a metric space explicit.</p>
<p>You just need to configure the algorithm implicitly with the metric for your data.</p>
<p>All algorithms in the METRIC framework are designed to be used in a two-phase approach. First, the algorithm must be
configured with the metric and - if also required - training data or additional parameters. After the construction, the
object can be used.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">using namespace metric;

using rec_t = std::vector&lt;double&gt;;

std::vector&lt;rec_t&gt; A = {
        { 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3 },
        { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
        { 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0 },
        { 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0 },
        { 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
        { 5, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
        { 4, 6, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0 }}; // a set with seven records

rec_t b = { 2, 8, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 }; // a single record.

Algorithm&lt;Euclidean&lt;rec_t&gt;&gt; algo(A,2); // configure an algorithm with euclidean metric, training data and an additional parameter

auto result1 = algo(b); // apply the default method
auto result2 = algo.estimate(b); // apply a special method
</code></pre>

<h2 id="explicit-metric-spaces">Explicit metric spaces</h2>
<p>METRIC provides three classes to build explicit metric space (DistanceMatrix, KNNGraph and SearchTree). All classes
provide the same methods, but they have different computational advantages.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">DistanceMatrix&lt;Manhatten&lt;rec_t&gt;&gt; dMat(A); // build a full pair-wise representation
KNNGraph&lt;Manhatten&lt;rec_t&gt; knnG(A); // build a local and sparse representation
SearchTree&lt;Manhatten&lt;rec_t&gt;&gt; sTree(A); // build a hierarchical organized tree representation

auto distance = dMat(0,3) // accessing the distance value by IDs.
auto nn_ID = sTree.nn(b); //searching for the best matching record of b in the metric space (aka next neighbor)
</code></pre>

<p>There are two main scenarios, where it makes sense to use explict metric spaces.</p>
<p>1) When you want to find the best matching record or subsets
2) when you want to update your metric space in realtime and want to keep the distance computations updated
   incrementally.</p>
<h2 id="distance-functions">Distance functions</h2>
<p>There is a hugh collection of distance function in METRIC available, but you can also use your own functions. The
Distance functions library is organized in three groups (random, related and structured). This framework provides only
real metric and pseudo-metric, (also known as semi-metrics), that fulfill the triangle inequality.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)</p>
<h3 id="random-metrics">Random metrics</h3>
<p>The corresponding indices of two records are not related to each other. Also, the records can have a different sizes.
This is normally the case, when the values of a record represent random observations of one dimension.</p>
<pre><code>Record 1    [1.3, 7.2, 5.8, 7.3, 2.7, 5.5 ...]
Record 2    [2.1, 6.2, 1.2, 6.2, 2.5  ...]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="related-metrics">related metrics</h3>
<p>The values of two records are related, when the order of the indices can be changed without effecting the result of the
distance computation. This is normally the case, when each index of a record represents a dimension and the value
represents one observation. The dimensions are regarded as independent to each other in principle. In comparison to the
random metrics, different samples are provided by the records and not by the values in one record.</p>
<pre><code>Record 1    [1.3, 7.2, 5.8, 7.3, 2.7, 5.5, ...]
              |    |    |    |    |    |   
Record 2    [2.1, 6.2, 1.2, 6.2, 2.5, 4.2, ...]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="k-structured-metrics">k-structured metrics</h3>
<p>When the indices in a record have a structural meaning like the bin position in a histogram or the pixel position in a
picture, you normally use a structured metric. Here the known dependency of the dimension is used for better results.</p>
<pre><code>Record 1    [1.3, 7.2, 5.8, 7.3, 2.7, 5.5, ...]
             |  X |  X |  X |  X | |  X |
Record 2    [2.1, 6.2, 1.2, 6.2, 2.5, 4.2, ...]
</code></pre>

<p>In the most case, you will configure an algorithm with a distance function, but of course you can construct and use a
distance function manually.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">rec_t a = { 1, 2, 5, 3, 1 };
rec_t b = { 2, 2, 1, 3, 2 };

auto distance_function = P_norm&lt;rec_t&gt;(1.5); //configure a Minkowski metric with p=1.5

double result = distance_function(a, b); //apply the metric
</code></pre>

<p>It's easy to provide and use your own metric. To do so, you have to define a struct with a methods that overloads the ()
-operator, and you have to provide the inner value type as Val_T.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">struct user_euclidean {
    using Val_T = double; // necessary template line.
    double operator()(std::vector&lt;double&gt; a, std::vector&lt;double&gt; b) // overload the ()-operator 
        {
        /* start of implementation */
        double sum=0;
        for (int i =0; i&lt; a.size(); i++){
                sum += std::pow(a[i]-b[i],2);
        }
        return std::sqrt(sum);
        /* end of implementation*/
    }
};
</code></pre>

<h2 id="computing-with-metric-spaces">Computing with metric spaces</h2>
<p>Each data set to which a matching metric is assigned, is already a metric space by definition. So you don't have to
compute metric spaces explicitly, and normally you can use the algorithms with common data input.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; B = {
        &quot;this&quot;,
        &quot;is&quot;,
        &quot;a&quot;,
        &quot;vector&quot;,
        &quot;of&quot;,
        &quot;strings&quot;}; // a set with six records
auto entropy = Entropy&lt;Edit&lt;std::string&gt;&gt;(); //configure the entropy computation

double result = entropy(B); // compute the entropy

</code></pre>

<p>The meaning of entropy for a metric spaces is different from the classical shannon entropy, that is discrete. The
entropy in METRIC is based on the concept of differential entropy and has the meaning of a local degree of freedom in
the dataset. It can be regarded alternatively as mean intrinsic dimensionality over the space, no matter how many real
dimensions are provided.</p>
<p>Anyway, like correlation in the intro example the entropy gives only an information about the existence of a
dependencies in the data. To model this dependency you have to apply one of the provided feature extractors mechanisms.</p>
<p>Imaging a setting, where you take a colored 400x300 photos of a scene at random time. In this scene only a door is
opened and closed in some intermediate states. All pixels can change from photo to photo, but there are actually only
two independent things happening, the door opening angle and the lighting setup show variations. We call this kind of
intrinsic dimensionality "features". While the original record has 400<em>300</em>3 = 360000 dimension, it has only 2 intrinsic
dimension.</p>
<p>It is important to understand, that the concept of metrics space is only applicable, when the amount of recorded
dimensions are highly correlated to each other and the intrinsic dimensions are not increasing with the number of
records. If this is the case, the curse of dimensionality will prevent any analysis or insights. But that is not a limit
of the metric space concept. It is a limit at all.</p>
<p>The methods to extract features are also known as dimension reduction techniques. But this name is a little misguiding,
because we are not changing the recorded dimension, we are extracting only the underlying features that lead to the
recorded dimensions and put them in a new metric space. Or in other word, we filter out the most important information
to make further processing easier and to break down complicated dependencies to a human understanding like a
2d-information.</p>
<p>The most aggressive feature extractor is called clustering. Here a metric space is split into several similar groups and
only a categorical liable is mapped as feature.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">auto [data, lables] = loadDataSet(&quot;NYC_taxi&quot;)
auto cluster = KOC&lt;TWED&lt;rec_t&gt;&gt;(data); //configure the clustering

auto lable = cluster(data[0]); // apply the clustering to first sample
</code></pre>

<p>A less aggressive feature extraction is archived with a continuous mapper.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">auto [data, lables] = loadDataSet(&quot;MNIST&quot;);
auto f_extractor = Autoencoder&lt;SSIM&lt;rec_t&gt;&gt;(data); //configure the clustering

auto features = f_extractor(data[0]); // apply the feature extraction to the first sample
</code></pre>

<p>When you find correlations between metric spaces, you can model them with continuous mappers. For example, you first
extract deterministic features of a picture, then map this space to its denoised manifold and measure the distance to
the manifold as outliner distance and then approximate the solution with a neural network for faster computation.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">using namespace metric;
using namespace std;
using Container = std::vector;
Container&lt;Image&gt; data = loadDataSet(&quot;Donuts&quot;);

auto hog_extractor = HOG(data[0].width, data[0].hight); // setup histogram of oriented gradients feature extractor

Container&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt; histograms = hog_extractor(data); // compute the histograms

auto outliner_model = Rediff&lt;Euclidean&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;&gt;(histograms); // compute the manifold of the histogram space

Container&lt;double&gt; outliners = outliner_model(histograms); // compute the outline distance for all images

auto model = ESN&lt;Image,double&gt; (data, outliners); // train an approximation model

model.save(&quot;myModel.cereal&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>then load and apply the model:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">auto model = ESN&lt;Image,double&gt;(&quot;myModel.cereal&quot;);
double outliner_score = model(Img1); // compute the outline score for an image
</code></pre>

<h1 id="why-panda-metric-is-awesome">Why PANDA | METRIC is awesome</h1>
<p><strong>PANDA | METRIC</strong> extends the capabilities of machine learning algorithms for variable structured data types and
enables statements to be made about the relationships between the data in the context of artificial intelligence. For
this purpose, the recorded data is first modeled using a metric in a metric space. These spaces can now be related to
each other and simplified without loss of information. This allows essential information to be extracted and accessible
to the user. In various modules, the framework offers a collection of algorithms that are optimized for metric spaces
and accessible via a standardized API.</p>
<p><strong>PANDA | METRIC</strong> is located in the area of machine learning and artificial intelligence, but offers more than a loose
collection of optimized and high class algorithms, because PANDA | METRIC combines these different algorithms seamless.
Data Science is no magic, it is all about information theory, statistics and optimization methods and PANDA | METRIC
provides all you need to generate data-driven added values. All algorithms in data science seems like a huge loosely
connected family. This framework provides a universal approach that makes it easy to combine these techniques. This
framework brings all these algorithms under the theory of metric spaces together and guides, how to combine them.</p>
<p><strong>PANDA | METRIC</strong> is programmed in modern and template based C++, which allows a comfortable use with optimal
performance at the same time. Compared to the approach of neural networks, the concept of metric spaces offers
considerable advantages especially for industrial applications.</p>
