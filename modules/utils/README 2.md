# UTILS
*Utility classes for PANDA | METRIC framework.*

## Overview

Module contains algorithms which are not
metric either, but which can be easily combined. On the
one hand, there is a high-performance in-memory
**_crossfilter_**. This allows a piecewise, UI supported and
interactive filtering of the patterns from the results of the
operations in real time. On the other hand, the UTILS
module also contains a nonlinear and nonparametric
signifcance test for independent features (**_PMQ_**) of a
metric space that were obtained by mapping.
