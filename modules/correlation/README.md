# METRIC | CORRELATION
*A templated, header only C++17 library for nonlinear correlation of arbitrary data structures and types.*

## Overview

Module offers functions
to calculate a correlation coefficient of two metric spaces
and thus to determine the dependency of two arbitrary
data sets. METRIC | CORRELATION is used to find relations between metric spaces at all. 

Use MGC (Multiscale Graph Correlation)
as correlation coefficient to find nonlinear dependencies in data sets. It is optimized for small data set sizes.

## Simple use 

Compute the mgc correlation based on two datasets A and B.

If you don't have distance matrices, yo can build them at first (euclidean metric will be used with this embedded functions).

```C++
auto A = metric::distance_matrix(dataset) // std::vector<std::vector<double> dataset 
```

Then just create MGC object and call `()` operator:

```C++
typedef std::vector<int> Record;
typedef metric::Euclidean<double> Distance;

auto mgc_corr = metric::MGC<Record, Distance, Record, Distance>();
auto result = mgc_corr(A, B);

// out:
// result: 0.626877
```

*For a full example and more details see `examples/correlation_examples/simple_example.cpp`*



## Estimate

For large datasets computing of the correlation can take a lot of time, then MGC has the `estimate()` method, 
which will save a lot of time. For use it just call `estimate()` on MGC object:

```C++
typedef std::vector<int> Record;
typedef metric::Euclidean<double> Distance;

auto mgc_corr = metric::MGC<Record, Distance, Record, Distance>();
auto result = mgc_corr.estimate(A, B);

// out:
// result: 0.626877
```

*For a full example and more details see `examples/correlation_examples/advanced_example.cpp`*

But the real power with mgc is to compare different types and different metrics. Therefor use mgc as functor.

##  Function (object) / functor with user types and metrics


At first here are some types and metrics:
```C++

struct simple_user_euclidian {

    double operator()(const std::vector<double>& a, const std::vector<double>& b) const
    {
        double sum = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
            sum += (a[i] - b[i]) * (a[i] - b[i]);
        }
        return std::sqrt(sum);
    }
};

typedef std::vector<double> Rec1;
typedef std::array<float,3> Rec2;
typedef simple_user_euclidian Met1;
typedef metric::Manhatten<float> Met2;
````
Now build the function (object) and compute the mgc again:
```C++
auto mgc_corr = metric::MGC<Rec1, Met1, Rec2, Met2>();
auto result2 = mgc_corr(dataset1, dataset2);
```
dataset1 and dataset2 could be different containers, but must correspond to the same data record IDs of course, so they must have same sizes.

## Run
*You need STL and C++14 support to compile.*

METRIC | CORRELATION works headonly. Just include the header into your project.

```cpp
#include "modules/correlation.hpp"
```

or directly include one of specified distance from the following:

```cpp
#include "modules/correlation/mgc.hpp"
```



#### CMake compilation

Inside folder with your cpp file or inside `examples/correlation_examples/` run the following commands:

_Windows_

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -A x64 -T llvm
```
Then open solution in the Microsoft Visual Studio

_Linux_

Just run cmake
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Direct compilation, using compiler

```bash
$ clang++ ./examples/correlation_examples/simple_example.cpp -std=c++17
```
