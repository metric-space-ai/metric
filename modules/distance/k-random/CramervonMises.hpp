 * @brief
 *
 * The Cramér-von Mises (CM) distance is obtained by summing the squared difference between the two empirical CDFs along the x-axis (and then taking the square root of the sum to make it an actual distance). 
 * The relationship between the CM distance and the EMD is analogous to that of the L1 and L2 norms. 
 * CDFs is calculated by PMQ.
 * 
 * @tparam Sample - sample type
 * @tparam D - distance return type
