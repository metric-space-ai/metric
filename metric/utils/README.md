# UTILS

*Utility classes for PANDA | METRIC framework.*

## Overview

Module contains algorithms which are not metric either, but which can be easily combined. On the one hand, there is a
high-performance in-memory
**_crossfilter_**. This allows a piecewise, UI supported and interactive filtering of the patterns from the results of
the operations in real time. On the other hand, the UTILS module also contains a nonlinear and nonparametric signifcance
test for independent features (**_PMQ_**) of a metric space that were obtained by mapping.
